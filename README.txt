A Secret Message

Overview

Remember the good old days when you used to send notes in class? When getting a message across wasn't as easy as sending an iMessage?

This website will let you type in a message and encrypt it for you. You'll be able to re-live the life of not only students in the late 90's, but also some of the smartest spies whose mission relied on getting secret messages accross borders. 

Are you up for the challenge?

This website lets you implement ceasershift ciphers and vigenere ciphers!

Decyrpt with or without a key!

Data Model:

The app will take user input and encrypt or decrypt it, based on what the user asks for.

It will have different algorithms running based on what cipher the user wants.
A user can encrypt/decrypt multiple messages at a time. 
All messages will be stored in their profile. 
Example: 

{"ceaser", "attackAtDawn", "dwwdfnDwDdzq", 3}


Wireframes: See Documentation folder.

as a user, I can log in to the site
as a user, I can sign up for the site
as a user, I can use the decrypter and encrypter
as a user, I can view all of the previous ciphers i've encrpted and decrypted, including the key and type of encrytion
as a user, I can add more messages

Research Topics
(6 points) Using Location of user
  Going to try and use the physical address of the user to use as a key 

(5 points) Integrate user authentication
  I'm going to be using passport for user authentication
